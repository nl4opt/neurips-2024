# Neurips-2024

The NL4Opt NeurIPS 2022 competition aimed to enhance the accessibility and ease of use of optimization solvers. 
It was focused on automating the process of converting natural language descriptions of problems into proper formulations for optimization solvers. 
However, the process of doing so often requires the expertise of optimization research professionals and can be time-consuming. 
The competition challenged participants to develop innovative methods to automate this process, making it more efficient and accessible to non-experts. 
The competition aimed to answer the following question: Can natural language interfaces based on machine learning be used to convert linear programming (LP) word problems into a format that solvers can understand?
