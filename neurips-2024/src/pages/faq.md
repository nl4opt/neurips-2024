We have listed some frequently asked questions below. If you still have any further questions, please refer to the [Contact page](https://nl4opt.github.io/neurips-2024/contact/) of the website to reach our organizers.

**Q**: *How do I participate in the competition?*

You just need to register by filling out the registration form in the [Participate page](https://nl4opt.github.io/neurips-2024/participate/). On the first page, submit your team name, contact email address, name of each member of your team and their affiliations, and confirm that each participant has read through and accept the [Rules of the competition](https://nl4opt.github.io/neurips-2024/rules/). On the second page, there are some personal information that we ask you to optionally disclose. We will only use this information to better understand the reach of our competition and how we can better promote future competitions. You will also have to register an account to [submit to Codabench](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/2598/).

**Q**: *How many members can we have on a team?*

There is no limit to the number of members on a team.

**Q**: *I do not have a team. Can I still participate?*

Yes, we welcome individuals as well as teams to participate.

**Q**:  *Can we use other datasets?*

- Using proprietary datasets or proprietary language models (ones only you and your affiliations have access to, or those behind a paywall) are NOT permitted.

- However, open-sourced datasets and language models are permitted for use.

- You are allowed to build your own dataset as long as you open source (after the competition) any data used throughout your model fine-tuning process.

- Automatic data augmentation that creates variants of the provided dataset instances is permitted. You must however indicate so in the description of your submission and explain how it helps improve the performance of robustness of your model. For more information. read the "Use of Data" in the "Rules" section of this website.

**Q**: *What do I need to make a submission?*

<!-- * Make sure you include the following in your submission:

  * Same ID code given after registration to identify their multiple submissions.

  * A Poetry configuration to manage the participant's Python library dependencies in a deterministic way. Please refer to the template in the starter kit and tutorial for a step-by-step guide.

  * A binary file for the trained model.

  * If the output of your model format is different from that of the baseline model provided im the starter kit, please provide a conversion script. Please refer to the tutorial for more details.

  * For the second sub-task. if you used a different meaning representation. please provide a script to convert their model prediction to the canonical format used for evaluation. Refer to the example/default conversion script in the starter kit. -->

* More details will follow. Keep an eye out on the competition website and our socials.

* Winning submissions will be required to include a brief description of your method.

**Q**: *What impact will my work have?*

We created this competition to explore the use of LLMs for domain-specific tasks, in this case operations research modeling. Your work will help us better understand the limitations of LLMs.

**Q**: *Has anything like this been done before?*

This dataset is unique and the tasks have never been done before.

**Q**: *What are the prizes?*

A total monetary prize of $21,000 USD will be awarded. The best winning submissions will be awarded the following prizes:

- **1st place:** $6,000, along with a comprehensive package covering partial travel expenses for the in-person presentation at NeurIPS

- **2nd place:** $3,000, plus partial travel expense coverage

- **3rd place:** $1,000, including partial travel expense support

- **Student award:** $500 for the highest-ranking student groups outside the top 3
